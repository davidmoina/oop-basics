# OOP Basics

This is a project to improve my knowledge in object-oriented programming, understand **Herency**, how to use **Abstraction**, what is **Polymorphism** and what **Interfaces** are and what they are used for.

## Getting Started

You can download the project and view it in a code editor like Visual Studio Code. In order to see the index.php you will need to download the XAMPP tool to create an Apache server and be able to view the content in the browser.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Xampp to run an Apache server and be able to run PHP.


## Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php) - Server side programming language
